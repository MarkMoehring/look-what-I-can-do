## A Snippet of My Potential

Howdy!  If you're reading this, which is obvious, you are curious about me and my coding abilities.

I hope this portfolio will showcase my work positively, as it is to this point in time.

Please be kindly, but brutally honest in your internal feedback.  And if you'd like to share it externally with me, I am always up to see your "certain point of view".

Sincerely though, help a brother out...

*Happy Coding!*
