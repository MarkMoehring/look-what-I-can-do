## A Snippet of My Potential

Howdy!  If you're reading this, which it's obvious you are, you are curious about me and my coding abilities.

I hope this [portfolio](https://markmoehring.github.io/look-what-I-can-do/) will showcase my work positively, as it is to this point in time.

It is still a work in progress, but you can see it is coming along nicely.

Please be kindly, but brutally honest in your internal feedback.  And if you'd like to share it externally with me, I am always up to see your "certain point of view".

Sincerely though, help a brother out...

*Happy Coding!*
